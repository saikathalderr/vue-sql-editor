## Tech

- I have used Vue3 with Vite
- `papaparse` for parsing CSV files
- `pinia` for state management
- `daisyui` & `tailwindcss` for the UI âœ¨ (you should try the dark mode ðŸŒš - ðŸ’¡ sync with system theme)

## Performance
Used chrome's lighthouse & performance insights to measure

it takes around 10ms to load the app, and a whole user journy from a small size query data rendering to the large data (around 1k entry) rendering takes around 728ms to complete.

The lighthouse performance score is 93+ (ðŸŸ¢ green)
